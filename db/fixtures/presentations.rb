Askins served as Special District Judge for the District Court of Stephens County for eight years, from 1982-1990. In 1991, the Governor appointed her to the Pardon and Parole Board, which elected her as its first female Chairman. She later served as Executive Director of the Pardon and Parole Board and as Deputy General Counsel to the Governor. These experiences helped develop her expertise in criminal and juvenile justice issues. <br/>Askins was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1994 from District 50 (Stephens, Comanche and Cotton Counties) and served for twelve years. In her last term (2005-2006), she earned the position of Democratic House Leader, becoming the first woman to lead a caucus in the Oklahoma Legislature. She won statewide election as Lieutenant Governor in November 2006, becoming the first Democratic woman to attain that position. On January 8, 2007, Askins took the oath of office for a full four-year term."
